# Mental Health Survey Analysis

This project analyzes mental health survey data to identify factors contributing to depression. Using Python, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning, it uncovers trends and builds predictive models to understand mental health risks.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
- **EDA**: Visualized data distributions and correlations.
- **Machine Learning**: Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict depression risk.
- **Insights**: Identified key factors like age, gender, and family history.
